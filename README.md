# Customer Churn Report in PowerBI

In response to a growing demand from various teams wanting to better understand customer churn, I developed a comprehensive Churn report in PowerBI. The report features visualizations that are interactive, self-serve and automated to empower end users to make data-driven decisions. 

**Please note that the data fields/results/labels have been blocked-out for confidentiality purposes. 

## Dashboard
This is the first tab of 7 that gives a high level overview of customer churn activity broken out by different KPI's.

I built a filter panel to allow users to drill down on various metrics, while maximizing space on the dashboard for visualizations.

## Data Model
The data model follows the star schema method, which is explained in detail [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/guidance/star-schema).
